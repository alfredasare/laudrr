                    People around the world are demanding clean air -- and cities are starting to respond, says
                    electrification advocate Monica Araya. She takes us on a world tour of urban areas that are working
                    to fully electrify their transportation systems over the next decade, shifting to emission-free
                    motorcycles, cars, buses, ferries and beyond. See what a future without the internal combustion
                    engine could look like -- and what it will take to get there.
